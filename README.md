Statistical Machine Learning for Biological and Information Systems

This repo contains my work from the aforementioned course. A description of the course can be seen below taken from the syllabus.

Ongoing advancements in information systems as well as the
emerging revolution in microbiology and medicine are creating a deluge of data, whose
mining, inference and prediction will have an enormous economic, social, scientific and
medical/therapeutic impact. For example, in biology, microarray technology is creating
vast amounts of gene expression data, whose understanding could lead to better
diagnostics and potential cure of cancer. Similarly, in information systems, companies
like Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc., are facing various problems on massive data sets,
e.g., ranking and community detection. This course will cover a variety of fundamental
statistical (machine) learning techniques that are suitable for the emerging problems in
these application areas, but also applicable in general. The students will gain a
comprehensive knowledge in both supervised and unsupervised learning.

Further informatoin can be found in the syllabus which can be accessed via the URL below.
