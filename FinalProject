Contents for final project of Statistical Machine Learning for Biological and Information Systems.

In this project I, alongside my partner, replicate the results of a published machine learning model for human behavior identification from smartphone inertial sensor data
as well as exploring tree-based models of our own.

By the end of the project, we had a tree-based model which improved upon the published paper's test accuracy and which had greater interpretability of the featurespace.
